# ‚ú® GenAI Experiments

This repository collects small examples for exploring generative AI concepts using Python. Each folder focuses on a different topic, ranging from basic terminology to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## üìÅ Repository Structure

| Folder | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `01 What is GenAI` | Article and code explaining common AI jargon, tokenization and embeddings. |
| `02 Master Prompting` | Examples of zero-shot, few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting with OpenAI and Gemini. |
| `03 Agent` | Simple tool-using agent powered by Groq's Llama model. |
| `05 RAG` | Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline with LangChain and Qdrant. |

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd GenAI
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file with the API keys required by the examples (OpenAI, Groq, etc.).

See the README inside each folder for detailed instructions.
